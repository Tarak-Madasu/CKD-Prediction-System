Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction and Stage Classification

**Project Overview**
-This project focuses on the prediction and stage classification of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using advanced machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a highly accurate, reliable, and early detection system to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing CKD.
-Three different approaches were implemented and evaluated:
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
Stacked Model: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) combined with XGBoost
-The best-performing model is deployed in a user-friendly web application where patient details can be input to receive CKD prediction and stage classification.

**Features**
Early CKD Detection: Detects the presence of CKD at an early stage.
Stage Classification: Accurately classifies CKD into stages (Non-CKD, Stage 1 to Stage 5).
Web Application: Integrated Random Forest model into an interactive Flask web app for real-time predictions.
